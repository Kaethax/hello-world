# hello-world
First repository to train etc.

I hope to learn some statistics, Python and R, afterwards go for machine learning and use those skills in data analysis of neurobiological datasets. Right now I am after my MSc in molecular biotechnology, I want to become data scientist, in a way, I guess.
